## 1. ABSTRACT
Every processing facility strives to produce the primary output product at the maximum capacity while simultaneously
retaining cost effectiveness to achieve optimum productivity. Zillions of data points produced during a process can be
observed, but manually observing a pattern and designing a mathematical model may be difficult. To solve this issue, using
machine learning algorithms on data points plays a vital role in developing empirical mathematical models. Dimethyl ether
(DME) is a significant industrial compound with numerous uses. We worked on optimizing DME production using machine
learning methods in this research report. In the study, prediction models were created employing various machine
learning methods, including ANN, random forests, and support vector machines. The models were deployed to determine
the ideal operating conditions for DME production after being trained on a sizable dataset of process parameters and
production data. The outcomes demonstrated that the machine learning models could accurately forecast DME yields and
that the optimal operating parameters they suggested were in good accord with those attained using conventional
optimization techniques. The study underscores the significance of integrating such techniques into industrial processes for
greater efficiency and sustainability, and it shows the potential of machine learning algorithms for process optimization.
## 2. INTRODUCTION
The profitability and efficiency of the chemical business are two things it constantly looks to increase. Knowing the
relationships between different physical factors encountered while running a chemical plant is one of the main areas of
concentration. Learning more about these relationships can help us forecast the outcomes for a given set of parameters
and utilize that knowledge to streamline the procedure.
To simplify the automation of these operations and boost efficiency, this project aims to close the gap between the
operations in chemical plants and the application of machine learning algorithms.
We explored the synthesis of Dimethyl Ether (DME) using methanol dehydration. The primary reason for choosing DME
is its potential to be used as fuel to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from combustion
engines, as an extraction solvent for a variety of food products, as a propellant in aerosol goods, and as a component of hair
spray. To gather data points, we designed a Computer-aided design of a DME production plant using Aspen Hysys. Itâ€™s a
good option to use a simulation tool like Aspen Hysys to gather data because it ensures the information is accurate. It
eliminates the need for manual data collecting. By employing machine-generated data, we lessen the possibility of adding
human mistakes to the data collection process. To generate an empirical relationship between input parameters (feed
temperature, pressure, flow rates.) and output parameters, these data points were modeled using ML algorithms (product
yield). We used Artificial Neural
